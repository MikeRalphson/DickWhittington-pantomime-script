# Dick Whittington
An original pantomime based on the story of Dick Whittington and his Cat

First performed in Stockcross, Berkshire UK in December 2012.

There are two versions in PDF form, the first is basically the read-through / rehearsal script, and v1.1 is closer to the script as performed over the three-night run, incorporating some cast improvements and staging changes.
